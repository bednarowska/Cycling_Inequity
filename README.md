# Cycling Inequity Data
Data used in the paper "Ethnic inequalities in cycling to work in London - mobilities injustice and regional approach" published in Regional Studies, Regional Science

The modeling was done in 2019-2021.
The dataset comprises several types of data used for the spatial econometric model in the paper. 
I created the dataset using socio-economic and regional data from the London Datastore (Greater London Authority, 2019) 
and the transportation data (Transport for London, 2019). The outcome variable is taken from the most recent 2011 census 
(Greater London Authority, 2019). See details in the paper.

Once the article is published, the repository will be updated with:
* the final version of a dataset
* code to run spatial model
* instructions how to use the code and data.
