# Cycling Inequity Data
Data used in the paper "Mobilities injustice and regional inequalities in cycling to work" (currently under the review)

The dataset comprises several types of data used for the spatial model in the paper. 
I created the dataset using socio-economic and regional data from the London Datastore (Greater London Authority, 2019) 
and the transportation data (Transport for London, 2019). The outcome variable is taken from the most recent 2011 census 
(Greater London Authority, 2019). 

Once the article is accepted for publication, the repository will be updated with:
* the final version of a dataset
* code to run spatial model
* detailed instructions how to use the code and data.
