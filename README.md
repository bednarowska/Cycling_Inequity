# Cycling Inequity Data
Data used in the paper "Ethnic inequalities in cycling to work in London - mobilities injustice and regional approach" published in Regional Studies, Regional Science

The dataset comprises several types of numeric data used in the spatial econometric model. 
I created the dataset using socio-economic and regional data from the London Datastore (GLA, 2019) and the transportation data (Transport for London, 2019). The outcome variable is taken from the most recent 2011 census (GLA, 2019). See more details in the paper.

In order to run spatial statistics or spatial econometrics, you need shapefiles of London boroughs. The Statistical GIS boundaries for London are publicly available. 

Once the article is published, the repository will be updated with:
* the final version of a dataset
* R script to run spatial model.

Please note that research and main part of modeling was done in 2019, and later modified before publishing this paper.
